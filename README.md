Deployed URL: https://maxdmc1.github.io/weather-dashboard/


Description:

This weather app is designed to save cities from a user input to an array stored in local storage.  The script will read from the local storage and create a button for each so the user can recall what the current weather is for that particular city.  I had intended to also provide the 5 day forecast for each city (searched by the user or clicked from the previously selected city in the array).

Installation:

all files are stored in a single repository where the browser will run all of the pertinent information - in this case they are stored on the github servers
